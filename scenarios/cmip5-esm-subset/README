# cmip5-esm-subset

This scenario deploys an httpd gateway in spock, with 4 tomcat servers, 2 in wn023 and 2 in wn025.

## Data

The data in the TDS servers are those from the ZFS dataset in /oceano/gmeteo/WORK/zequi/DATASETS/cmip5-esm-subset/data. NcMLs and catalogs are generated using the `data` script. NcMLs are generated in /oceano/gmeteo/WORK/zequi/DATASETS/cmip5-esm-subset/ncmls. The catalog is generated in catalogs/cmip5-esm-subset.xml.

In order to execute the script, you need to have access to /oceano filesystem and the `tdspu` package (https://meteo.unican.es/gitbucket/git/zequi/cmip5-esm-subset-mon.git) installed (see requirements.yml) in your control machine.
